## Featured Projects

### Retailia: AI-powered Chatbot  
*Technologies: Python, NLP, Llama3, RAG, Langchain, Langraph, Agentic Retrieval Augmentation Generation*  
Built an AI chatbot for retail leveraging Llama 3 and Agentic Retrieval Augmentation Generation (RAG), automating 65% of routine queries (order tracking, returns) via real-time SQL DB lookups and FAISS vector search across 10K+ documentation pages, reducing response times by 40%. Python, SQL, Llama 3.1, RAG, Langchain, Langraph.

### [Healthcare Data Pipeline]  
*Technologies: Azure Data Factory, Databricks, Delta Lake, SQL Database*  
Designed and deployed an end-to-end Azure data pipeline using Data Factory, ADLS Gen2, Databricks, and SQL Database. Automated ETL workflows, implemented multi-zone data lake architecture, ensured data governance with Unity Catalog, Azure Key Vault for access control, optimized performance with parallel processing and incremental loads.

### [Neighborhood Theft Analysis] 
*Technologies: OpenRefine, GCP, GCS, Dataproc, Hadoop, BigQuery, Hive SQL, Spark SQl*  
Processed 15+ unstructured crime reports (PDFs/CSV) using OpenRefine, identifying 12 theft patterns (23% weekend spikes) from public datasets; Engineered a data pipeline using GCP (Dataproc, Hadoop), created tables using BigQuery, conducted advanced analysis with Hive and Spark, uncovering time-based crime patterns and insights.
